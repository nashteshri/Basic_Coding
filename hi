E-Commerce Application
• Service: CartService to manage the shopping cart.
• Components: ProductListComponent, CartComponent.
• Interaction:
• ProductListComponent uses CartService to add products.
• CartComponent uses CartService to display cart items and total price.
This approach demonstrates real-world use of components, templates, services, and dependency injection for scalable applications.
